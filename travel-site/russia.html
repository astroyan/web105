            <P>I have lived in Russia for a total of about seven months. For one month
                I lived in St. Petersburg, and the rest I lived in Moscow. Some of the
                cities that I traveled to in the Russian Federation include Tula,
                Volgograd, Kazan, Peterhof, Tsarskoye Selo, and Sergiyev Posad.
            </P>
            <P>
                My favorite part of traveling around Russia was the train rides. Russia
                has an incredible public transport and train system. The cross-country
                trains have cabins with four beds each, and often when our group
                would travel the two bottom bunks would belong to strangers. Those
                were the most interesting conversations, as the average Russian knows
                little to no English and most likely has never met anyone from America.
            </P>
            <P>Russia is an incredibly beautiful country with an immense history
                and warm people. I would love to return there someday and travel to
                even more cities and talk with even more people on the trains.
            </P>
