                <p>I am originally from the Pocono Mountain region of the Appalachian
                    Mountains. The picture to the left provides a nice illustration of
                    the size of the mountains where I was born.
                </p>
                <p>As far as states go, I have been to, or have driven through,
                    the following: Pennsylvania, New York, Massachussetts,
                    Connecticut, New Jersey, Virginia, West Virginia, South Carolina,
                    North Carolina, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Iowa, California,
                    Arizona, and Nevada. </p>
                <p>Of all the states and places I've been to in the U.S., I was the
                    most taken with West Virginia. The way that they laid the roads
                    over the mountains astounds me - it almost feels like a roller
                    coaster driving through parts of it.
                </p>

                <P>I moved out to Illinois in October of 2018 to be with my then-boyfriend,
                    now-fiance. The picture to the right is one that I took on one of my
                    many trips out here before I finally moved.
                </P>
                <P>Being from the mountains, one thing that really shocked me out here
                    was the immensity of the sky. I remember the first time I witnessed
                    a thunderstorm in the Midwest; I was so terrified because I could
                    see everything that was going on in the sky! I guess that's a good
                    thing - early warning system.
                </P>
                <P>So far, I have been to the Northeast, Midwest, and Southwest,
                    and in the future I would really like to travel to all parts of
                    the U.S., particularly less populated areas like Montana and the
                    Pacific Northwest.
                </P>
