    <h1>Review of The Strokes' <em>The New Abnormal</em></h1>

    <h2>A Well-balanced Formula</h2>
    <p>
        As a long time fan of the Strokes, I higly anticipated the
        release of this album. Their last album <em>Comedown Machine</em>,
        which was released in 2013, was met with mixed reviews, as it
        sharply departed from their previous sound in both promising
        and mediocre ways. For me, the first listen did not disappoint,
        and with each listen of the album I only grew to like it more.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <em>The New Abnormal</em>, the band returns
        to their roots, echoing moods and sounds from <em>Is This It?</em>
        while injecting eighties elements that keep the revival 
        on trend rather than stale. Most of "The Adults Are Talking" sounds
        like something right off of one of their first two albums, but
        the falsetto brings it back to their newer sound. Julian's falsetto
        actually makes an appearance on several of the tracks, notably
        "Eternal Summer" and "Why Are Sundays So Depressing." I personally
        welcome this vocal style from Julian, but I know it has also been
        met with criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
        The general album composition reminds me of their last record.
        A light, middle-of-the-road song to start ("Tap Out" vs. "The
        Adults Are Talking"), hard-hitting bangers sandwiched in the
        middle ("One Way Trigger" & "50/50" vs. "Brooklyn Bridge to
        Chorus"), and finishing off with a somber track ("Call It Fate,
        Call It Karma" vs. "Ode To The Mets").
    </p>
    <p>
        However, this is the first Strokes record that included
        synthesizers. Julian finally brought this element from his side and
        personal projects to The Strokes, and I think it is an excellent
        touch, particularly in "At The Door." Overall, the record 
        deviates just enough from their usual music to not be jarring,
        but offers distinct and new flavors that add another layer of
        sweet nostalgia.
    </p>
        <!-- could include track listing here -->
    <h3>Track Highlight: "At The Door"</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "I can't escape it /
        Never gonna make it /
        Out of this in time /
        I guess that's just fine"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The bare instrumentals coupled with Julian's unique voice make
        this my favorite track on the record. The choice to use only
        guitar and synth elevate this track and make the listener
        truly feel the helplessness and apathy the lyrics convey.
        The traditionally animated music video completes the "vintage"
        aesthetic.
