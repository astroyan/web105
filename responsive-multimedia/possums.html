                        What many in North America know as a possum is the only marsupial found north of
                        Mexico. Possums are nocturnal, and like squirrels, have become accustomed to suburban
                        and urban environments due to food availability. They are about the same size as a
                        common house cat, and are omnivorous.

                    <p>Possums are particularly interesting for several reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They have opposable thumbs on their back feet.</li>
                        <li>
                            They are one of the world's most variably sized animals. A male from the north
                            can weigh 20 times as much as a female from the tropics.
                        </li>
                        <li>They have 50 teeth and 10 incisors, more than any other North American land mammal.</li>
                        <li>
                            They eat up to 95% of the ticks that they encounter, which limits the spread of
                            Lyme Disease.
                        </li>
                        <li>They are immune to rabies, which in the wild is 100% fatal.</li>
                        <li>
                            They have a surprisingly small lifespan considering their size, on average
                            living less than two years.
                        </li>
