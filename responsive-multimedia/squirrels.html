                        The squirrels that most people are familiar with seeing in the Eastern part of the
                        United States is the Eastern Gray Squirrel, though they are a part of the Family called
                        <i>Sciuridae</i>, which includes many small to medium-sized rodents. Gray squirrels
                        have become adept at living in suburban and even urban environments (so long as there
                        are enough trees).

                        Gray squirrels tend to eat a wide variety of nuts and berries, but will also eat tree bark,
                        buds, and even mushrooms. They especially like pumpkins you leave out on the porch for
                        decoration. They are a type of tree squirrel, and while ground squirrels do hibernate,
                        tree squirrels do not. They do tend to fatten up for the winter, though, to have
                        some fat on reserve.

                        Gray squirrels are a major component in forest growth. They often store their food in caches
                        and can have several thousand caches at a time, but they are unfortunately rather forgetful,
                        and their forgotten caches turn into trees as a result.

                        Gray squirrels usually breed once to twice a year and generally have litters of one to four.
                        Baby squirrels become fully grown in a matter of eight or nine months. Females are usually
                        fertile after about a year, and males become sexually mature in a matter of one to two years.
                        Gray squirrels can live for as long as 20 years in captivity, but usually live only one to six
                        in the wild due to predation and habitat issues, among other things.

                        The accompanying video shows a family of gray squirrels living in a small house built in
                        someone's backyard. This particular litter has five squirrels in it.
